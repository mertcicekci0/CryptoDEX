***Cryptodex: Uniswap V2-Style Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Smart Contract***

This repository contains a smart contract implementation of a decentralized exchange (DEX) similar to Uniswap V2. The platform operates using a constant product formula for price determination and manages liquidity pools for token trading.

***Features***

-Token swapping and liquidity management
-Constant product formula pricing
-OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard security
-ERC20 token support
-Comprehensive event system
-Technical Details
-Contract Structure






```
contract Cryptodex {
    struct Reserve {
        uint112 reserve0;    // First token reserve
        uint112 reserve1;    // Second token reserve
        uint32 blockTimestampLast;  // Last block timestamp
    }

    mapping(address => mapping(address => Reserve)) public reserves;

    event Swap(
        address indexed trader,
        address indexed tokenIn,
        address indexed tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOut
    );

    event LiquidityAdded(
        address indexed provider,
        address indexed tokenA,
        address indexed tokenB,
        uint256 amountA,
        uint256 amountB
    );
}
```
Core Functions

1
Liquidity Addition (addLiquidity)
Adds liquidity to token pairs
Ensures minimum amount guarantees
Manages token transfers

2
Token Swapping (swap)
Executes token swap operations
Implements minimum output amount checks
Calculates prices based on reserves

3
Helper Functions
calculateAmountA: Calculates required token amount for liquidity addition
calculateAmountB: Determines required amount for counter token
calculateSwap: Computes swap amount using constant product formula
Security Features
Protection against reentrancy attacks
Minimum amount validations
Token pair validation
Transfer approvals

Developer Notes
This smart contract follows a widely-used architecture in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The platform operates using funds provided by liquidity providers and enables users to swap tokens.
